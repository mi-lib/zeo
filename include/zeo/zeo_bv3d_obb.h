/*! \brief oriented bounding box of points.
 *
 * zOBB() computes oriented bounding box of a set of points \a p.
 * \a num is the number of points. The result is put into \a obb.
 *
 * \a obb is a combination of a box and the attitude matrix.
 * About zBox3D class, see zeo_prim_box.h.
 *
 * zOBBPL() also computes oriented bounding box of a set of
 * points, which is given by a list of pointers to points \a pl.
 * \return
 * zOBB() returns a pointer \a obb.
