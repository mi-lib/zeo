/*! \brief Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm.
 *
 * zGJK() finds a pair of the closest points of convex hulls
 * of two sets of points \a p1 and \a p2. \a n1 and \a n2 are
 * the numbers of points of \a p1 and \a p2, respectively. The
 * pair of points found are stored in \a c1 and \a c2.
 *
 * zGJKPL() also finds a pair of the closest points of convex
 * hulls of two lists of points \a pl1 and \a pl2.
 *
 * \return zGJKPL() and zGJK() return the distance between the
 * closest points. If the convex hulls intersect, zero is returned
 * as the distance, and the center of intersection is put into
 * \a c1 and \a c2.
