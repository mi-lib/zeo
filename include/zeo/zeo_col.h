/*! \brief collision and intersection between an edge and a plane.

 * zColChkEdgePlane3D() sees if an edge \a e and a plane \a p
 * intersect with each other.
 *
 * zIntersectEdgePlane3D() calculates the all intersection
 * points between \a e and \a p, sets them into the array
 * \a ip and returns the number of them.
 * The following three cases can happen.
 *  1. \a e and \a p does not intersect. In this case, \a ip
 *     is not treated, and the function returns 0.
 *  2. \a e and \a p intersect at one point. In this case,
 *     the point is set into the first component of \a ip,
 *     and the function returns 1.
 *  3. \a e is perfectly on \a p. In this case, though infinite
 *     number of intersection points exist, the function
 *     only sets the two endpoints of \a e into the first
 *     and second components of \a ip.
 * Consequently, the number of intersection points is at
 * most two, so that the size of \a ip has to be more than
 * or equal to two.
 * \return
 * zColChkEdgePlane3D() returns the true value if \a e and
 * \a p intersect with each other. Otherwise, the false value
 * is returned.
 *
 * zIntersectEdgePlane3D() returns the number of intersection
 * points, 0, 1, or 2.
